Customer Retention & Churn Analysis Dashboard

-Project Overview
 This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to identify key factors leading to churn. Using data-driven insights, the dashboard visualizes the relationship between subscription 
 duration, monthly spending, customer support engagement, and app usage patterns. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for improving customer loyalty and reducing revenue loss.

-Key Insights from Data
 Based on the visual analysis of the dataset, several critical trends were identified:
 Early-Stage Churn Risk: Churn risk is highest during the initial months of subscription; offering loyalty rewards during the first quarter can secure long-term stays.
 Customer Support Impact: Higher support engagement correlates with better retention, suggesting that proactive customer contact can prevent churn.
 Spending & Satisfaction: High-spending customers maintain a high average satisfaction score of 4.35, indicating that a VIP tier could protect this high-revenue segment.


-Engagement Patterns: Users with 10-15 monthly logins are the most loyal, while low-frequency users require targeted re-engagement campaigns.

-Tech Stack
 Data Visualization: Power BI / Tableau (as seen in the dashboard layout).
 Key Metrics Tracked: * Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): 126.12.
 Avg. Customer Satisfaction: 4.35.
 Total Subscriber Base: 15K.
 Monthly Churn Rate: 0.10%.

-Dashboard Features
